# Treasure-Island
 # Instructions
 Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and
`elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program. 
 [To write your code according to my story, you can use this flow chart from draw.io to help you.

 However, I think the fun part is writing your *own* story 😊
 🧞‍♂️ 🐊 🧙‍♂️ 🧟 🧚‍♂️ 🧝‍♂️ 🥷 🤖 👽 🙀 
 That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...
 ### Text Snippets from my example
 * 'You\'re at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
* 'You\'ve come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a
boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
* "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and
one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
* "It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
* "You found the treasure! You Win!"
* "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
* "You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
* "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
* "You fell into a hole. Game Over."
 # Escaping Characters
 If you want to use multiple sets of quotes inside a single string, you might have to "escape"
some of them using the backslash `\`. You can see this in my first sentence: 'You\'re at a
crossroad...'. [More on escaping characters here.](https://www.w3schools.com/python

 # Extensions
 Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case
sensitive. In other words, your code should work regardless of whether your user answers "left"
or "Left".
